Design Considerations

The following is the design we are considering


Assignment 1

Will be implemented with the following design for now.

Documentation
    Classes will be implemented with javadoc ensuring that parameters and returns are clearly documented

Controller class
The task will be implemented by using a controller class which will initialize the coin slot and buttons. It will hold machine states and methods to control the function of the vending machine.


Coin Slot
    Implement Listeners where actions invoke methods in the controller class

Buttons
    Implement Listeners where actions invoke methods in the controller class
    
Testing
    Test Controller Class, Coin Slot and Listeners, Buttons and Listeners to full or near full code coverage
