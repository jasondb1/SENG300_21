Our Typical Git Workflow

I think the following is a simple workflow that we can use

Guides:
http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ (Good basic guide to commands)
https://developer.ridgerun.com/wiki/index.php/Typical_Git_workflow

Information summarized from the above guides
Typical Workflow are as follows

   1.  get local copy of code
   2.  create a branch
   3.  edit files
   4.  add and commit changes to local machine (stage and commit, in eclipse or git gui)
   5.  get back in sync with changes commited by others (i.e. do a pull)
   6.  push branch to remote git repository
   
We may use pull request or    
   7.  merge local branch into local master
   8.  push local master to remote git repostiory
   
You should be able to do most of this in eclipse

Notes:
We want to make sure that the master branch is always a branch that compiles and works.


Summary for working on a branch
1. git checkout -b <feature_x> (creates a new branch feature_x and switches to it)

2. edit files on the branch
3. git add <filename> or git add .    (to add a file or all files, called stage changes in eclipse or some gui's)
4. git commit -m "Commit message"


5. git checkout master          (switch to master branch)
6. git pull                     (update your repository with changes others may have made)
7. get checkout <branch>
8. git push origin <branch>     (push branch to remote repository)

Merging into master

pull-request         

-or-

9. git merge <branch>                       (merges your changes into master branch on local machine)
10. git push origin master                  (push branch to remote repository)
